Diet: Carnivore
Behavior: Hostile

Perhaps one of the greatest risks when swimming is no longer drowning, but the possibility of being grabbed and consumed by something that cannot be seen. The Anomalocaris is a manifestation of that risk. One has to squint their eyes real hard to try find them before they are found, upon which their invisibility wears off.

While the Anomalocaris is a good option for stealth in water, one must take caution that, when they attack, their invisibility will wear off, potentially alerting everyone to their general presence and jeopardizing their safety. Other than for hiding, one can use the Anomalocaris to abduct unsuspecting creatures.

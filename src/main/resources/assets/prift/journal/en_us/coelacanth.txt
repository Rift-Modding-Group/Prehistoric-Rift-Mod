Diet: Insectivore
Behavior: Passive

The edibility of Coelacanths baffles me. I've had one and I couldn't taste anything for what felt like days, and my stomach has had far worse. It seems that the creatures that do consume it do not have this problem. I would never recommend this for consumption, but I think their meat can be processed into materials that have uses that don't involve food.

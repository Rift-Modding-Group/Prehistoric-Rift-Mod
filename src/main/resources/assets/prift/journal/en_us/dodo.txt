How peaceful it must be to be a Dodo, with no care in the world or concern for its own safety. Even other animals run upon being harmed, but this one never panics at the sight ofâ€¦ anything threatening. The only reason why they must be still alive is how they breed constantly, to the point where its not unusual to see one.

While too stupid to show companionship and too weak to contribute anything, Dodo Meat is surprisingly delicious, and consumption of such meat even blesses those who do with absorption.

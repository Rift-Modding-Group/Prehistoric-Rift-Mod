The Stegosaurus possesses tough plates on its back, yet at the end of its tail 3 detachable ones and 4 sharp spikes. These detachable plates can be thrown towards faraway aggressors, while the 4 sharp spikes puncture said would be aggressors that get too close. Their potential threat is amplified by the fact that they live in groups, so if one ever gets threatened all others follow suit.

Surprisingly there's enough space between the plates to put a saddle on them, where riders can be sheltered from most forms of harm. The spikes meanwhile, have peaceful uses, with applications in farming.

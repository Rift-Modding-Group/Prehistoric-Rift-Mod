Apatosauruses are amongst the largest creatures brought over by the Rift. They don't seem to care about their surroundings, and most smaller creatures don't bother it, probably out of respect for its imposing stature. Other than the fact that they can crush you or whip you to some place far away, not much else should be said of its power.

Its size and strength makes it unique enough to be able to utilize a platform saddle, where up to three passengers are supported and heavy weaponry can be mounted upon for use. The difficulty in convincing it to feed upon meals by hand in the wild however requires finding eggs to hatch in order to successfully domesticate.

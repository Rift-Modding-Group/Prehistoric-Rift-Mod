Behavior: Hostile

Dilophosauruses are rather ineffective at physical attacks, and thus completely rely on their spittable venom produced in a special organ in their neck. This venom, though not potent, is sticky, blinding the target for a short while.

Their venom spitting abilities prevents them from being a first line of defense for bases, but they work well as a form of support for other base defending creatures.

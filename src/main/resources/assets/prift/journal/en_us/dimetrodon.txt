Behavior: Neutral

The sail of the Dimetrodon inverts the temperature of the environment, causing warmer places to make it emit cold and vice versa. It even spreads to its fangs, allowing it to apply the harsher effects of the temperature its in to those it attacks, with flame mode letting them burn their targets and frost mode letting them cripple them.

With how stubborn or needy eggs can be when it comes to hatching, the Dimetrodon can be employed if one does not bother to bring eggs to their preferred hatching spots. Manually changing their temperature mode needs the use of stimulants that temporarily yet forcibly changes their temperature mode for a good amount of time.

Behavior: Passive

The main weapon of the Triceratops is its entire head, which serves as a shield. Completely impenetrable, it must be hit at other parts of the body, but thats easier said than done. The spikes on its head serve as additional weapons that can puncture their enemies, and one must take caution if it ever prepares to charge.

Though slow, the Triceratops is a rather easy and durable tame to take care of. The frill that serves as its shield protects is rider too, though I presume it makes aiming for the rider much more difficult. Additionally, one may command their Triceratops to charge into walls as if it were a battering ram.

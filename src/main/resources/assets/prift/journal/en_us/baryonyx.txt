The Baryonyx is an amphibious creature that primarily hunts in water, swiftly moving to catch its aquatic prey, while also venturing to land to hunt for terrestrial creatures. Its attacks include biting with its strong jaws and slashing with its weaker yet poisonous claws. Encountering a Baryonyx requires caution due to the unpredictability surrounding what form of attack it will choose.

Upon taming, the Baryonyx serves as an excellent amphibious mount. Its ability to navigate both land and even deep water makes it ideal for exploration. In combat, while its claw attack is weaker than its powerful bite, the added poison effect and its ability to fight both in water and on land make it a valuable ally.

Diet: Carnivore
Behavior: Hostile

Direwolves are pack hunters with a keen sense of smell. This makes it so that they can find prey by simply sniffing them out. Simply hiding being walls isn't an option as they will know that you're somehow there, until you are out of the range of their nose. They are also naturally disposed to fight for their packmates, with the leader motivating them by howling to push them to their limits.

While sniffing mobs is good enough, they also possess the ability to sniff out containers, spawners, and other mobs, which will come useful in exploration and in treasure hunting, made up for by how surprisingly strong it is for a pack hunter.

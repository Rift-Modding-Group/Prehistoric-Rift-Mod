Diet: Herbivore
Behavior: Neutral

Parasaurolophus are simple-minded herbivores that go in herds. The horns, besides making lots of noise, allow them to breathe in large amounts of air to then blow at their targets, possibly throwing them to far away places. This seems imposing, but one can sigh of relief over the fact that they are incapable of harm whatsoever. That doesn't mean they can't blow you into something else that is dangerous.

Their willingness to accept food from others makes Parasaurolophuses an easy tame, perfect for those who want to start in domestication. And while they are incapable of hurting anything with their powerful breath, perhaps they have other uses that involve using wind...

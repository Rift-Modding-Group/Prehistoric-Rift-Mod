Behavior: Neutral

Despite being far stronger than the other apex predators, Saurophaganax prefer to eat bugs and monsters instead of typical animals, and thus will only hunt at night. Their preferred prey is also fuel for a powerful light blast they can launch, which can burn and deal significant damage to all their preffered surrounding prey. By day, when all their favorite food disappears, they go to sleep, and are much weaker. Yet, their lack of competition ensures that nothing will even harm them.

As they don't reach full strength under the sun, the best places to bring them to are places where it can never reach to. Specifically, either to underground, or to other dimensions that lack a sun.

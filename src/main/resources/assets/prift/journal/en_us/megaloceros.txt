Behavior: Neutral

A notable trait of the Megaloceros are its antlers, which are its main source of strength. Yet its fragility makes it so weak it cannot break harder blocks or do worthwhile damage to their targets. For this, they stick in herds to ensure security, and run away if all else fails.

On the topic of their speed, Megaloceros are extremely fast and have a great jumping speed, in spite of how heavy the antlers look. The ease of taming as they do not attack upon sight makes them perfect for those with barely any supplies who just need a quick way to get around, but their slower energy recharge and obvious frailty means that one might have to replace them sooner or later...
